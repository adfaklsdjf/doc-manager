## Development Workflow

### For Each Task

1. **Planning** (15 min)
   - Review requirements
   - Identify dependencies
   - Define success criteria

2. **Implementation** (Variable)
   - Write code in small increments
   - Test as you go
   - Commit frequently

3. **Testing** (30 min)
   - Unit tests for new functions
   - Integration test if applicable
   - Document test results

4. **Documentation** (15 min)
   - Update EXPERIMENTS.md
   - Add code comments
   - Update relevant docs

### Daily Routine

**Start of Day**:
- Review CLAUDE.md for context
- Check previous experiment results
- Identify next task

**During Development**:
- Commit every 30 minutes
- Log decisions and findings
- Test incrementally

**End of Day**:
- Update EXPERIMENTS.md
- Push all changes
- Note next steps

## Success Checkpoints

### After Week 1
- [ ] Understand document patterns in archive
- [ ] Validated OCR quality
- [ ] Connected to paperless-ngx
- [ ] Proven LLM can classify documents

### After Week 2
- [ ] File watcher running reliably
- [ ] Documents being processed automatically
- [ ] 80% classification accuracy
- [ ] Organized folder structure working

### After Week 3
- [ ] Running in production on Unraid
- [ ] Processing new documents daily
- [ ] No manual intervention required
- [ ] Ready for v1.0 features

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks

**Risk 1**: LLM classification accuracy too low
- **Mitigation**: Start with high-confidence only, defer others
- **Fallback**: Rule-based classification for common types

**Risk 2**: paperless-ngx integration issues
- **Mitigation**: Test thoroughly in week 1
- **Fallback**: File system only for MVP

**Risk 3**: Performance problems with large batches
- **Mitigation**: Queue-based processing with rate limiting
- **Fallback**: Process in smaller batches

**Risk 4**: Windows VM stability
- **Mitigation**: Monitor and auto-restart
- **Fallback**: Investigate Linux OCR alternatives

## Resource Requirements

### Development Environment
- Python 3.11+
- Access to Unraid server
- Anthropic API key
- Test documents

### Production Environment
- 2GB RAM for services
- 10GB disk for database and logs
- Network access to scanner share
- Internet for LLM API

## Communication Plan

### Updates
- Daily: Update EXPERIMENTS.md
- Weekly: Review progress against plan
- Per milestone: Update ROADMAP.md

### Issues
- Blockers: Immediate discussion
- Decisions needed: Document options in relevant .md file
- Findings: Log in EXPERIMENTS.md

## Iterative Refinement Process

After each major component:
1. Deploy to test environment
2. Process 10 real documents
3. Review results
4. Identify improvements
5. Implement fixes
6. Re-test
7. Document lessons learned

## Definition of Done

A task is complete when:
- Code is written and tested
- Tests are passing
- Documentation is updated
- Changes are committed
- Results logged in EXPERIMENTS.md
