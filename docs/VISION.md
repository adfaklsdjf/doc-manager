# Vision & Problem Statement

## The Problem
I have great difficulty managing paper documents due to ADHD. The core issues:
- **Physical mail accumulates unopened** - Creates anxiety and missed obligations
- **No consistent organization** - Documents scattered, never findable when needed
- **Action paralysis** - Even when opened, documents rarely get acted upon
- **Manual filing is unsustainable** - Too much friction, requires executive function I don't reliably have

The current Documents folder is "where files go to die" - an archive graveyard rather than an active management system.

## Success Criteria (What "Solved" Looks Like)

### Immediate (MVP)
- âœ… Physical paper can be scanned with single button press
- ðŸ“‹ All documents are OCR'd and searchable
- ðŸ“‹ Documents automatically named with semantic meaning
- ðŸ“‹ Documents organized into logical folder structure
- ðŸ“‹ Can find any document when needed

### Near-term (v1.0)
- Documents automatically categorized by type
- Summary notifications of what was scanned
- Key information extracted (amounts, dates, parties)
- Timeline view of all documents

### Long-term (The Vision)
- System identifies required actions from documents
- Tracks bill payment status and autopay enrollment
- Monitors usage patterns and alerts on anomalies
- Tax-relevant information continuously extracted
- Integrates with broader personal AI assistant
- Becomes the "memory" for all document-based obligations

## Core Principles

### Behavioral Design
- **Friction must be near-zero** - If it requires thought, it won't happen
- **Defaults must be safe** - Better to defer than miscategorize
- **Progress over perfection** - 80% automation beats 0% manual

### Technical Design  
- **Living system** - Continuously learns and improves
- **Modular architecture** - New capabilities without rewrites
- **Self-hosted** - Data sovereignty is non-negotiable
- **Resilient** - Failures are logged, not lost

## Non-Goals (What We're NOT Solving)
- Media files (photos, videos, music)
- Code repositories
- Ebooks (separate system)
- General file backup (handled by other tools)
- Perfect accuracy on first pass (iteration is expected)

## The Deeper Why
"The things you own end up owning you" - Tyler Durden

Physical papers create mental burden disproportionate to their importance. By digitizing and automating their management, we reclaim mental space for things that matter. This isn't just about organization - it's about freedom from administrative overhead.

The goal is to channel unavoidable "hoarding" tendencies into the digital realm where they can be constructive rather than overwhelming. Keep everything, but organized and accessible, not suffocating.
